                                                                                 Sudoku


This is a fun sudoku game. Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle game, where an unfilled 9x9 grid is given as a 
question and it is to be filled with numbers 1 to 9, without any number occuring twice in any row, column
or 3x3 mini-grid. This makes sudoku fun to play!

The numbers are stored in a 2D integer array. It is called sudoku and all the empty spaces are filled with
zeroes.

We have 3 helper functions to achieve this. checkRow, checkColumn and checkBox. They check if the 
number entered already exists in the row, column and box. This is done by checking the number against 
every number present.

These are all combined in the core function, validity, which checks if the number is valid.

displayBoard is another core function we use. It prints the current sudoku board onto the terminal.

findEmptyBoxes is another core function in this mini-project. Here we check for any zeroes in the sudoku
array (which are empty spaces). If there are any zeroes, it indicates that the game isn't over. If there are 
no zeroes, it means that game is over and that the sudoku has been solved.

In the playGame variable we store if the player wants to continue playing or skip to the end. If the player 
choooses to skip to the end, the computer solves the sudoku board and displays the answer. But more on
that later.

The best aspect of this game is that the player enters the column and row numbers from 1 to 9, instead
of the array indices from 0 to 8. The player enters the row number, column number and number they
wish to enter in the 1x1 box.  If the number is valid, the updated board is displayed. If it is invalid, a 
message is displayed.

If, at any point, the player wishes to exit, they must enter 0 and the computer solves the game using the
sudokuSolver core function. It involves backtracking by trying a number in the first available empty space
and continues if it is valid. It goes for the next number in that 1x1 box if it is invalid. If no solution is present,
a message is displayed that no solution is possible for this board.
